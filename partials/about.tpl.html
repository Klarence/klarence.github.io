		<!--<p>I’m a Front-end Web Developer currently freelancing in San Jose, CA. I am technically proficient in HTML, CSS and implementing Javascript. Even though I get paid to develop websites, I also dabble in Graphic Design, Typography, Photography, Videography, and Animation. I love to stay on top of the latest technologies and immerse myself with everything the web has to offer.</p>-->

<p>Jack of all trades, and Master of One. I am a voracious learner when it comes to web development; my predominant passion, however, is intuitive design. “Form, Follows, Function” is my favorite design principle. While I do believe in creating beautiful aesthetic designs, I believe that every design element must have a purpose—it must contribute to the whole.  When designing, I work methodically with an emphasis on creating pixel perfect work.</p><p>

	I enjoying assisting my colleagues in overcoming their technical and sometimes very perplexing challenges. Discovering how technical and design elements mesh and achieve streamlined improvements as technology advances intrigues me. I use all information and learning to hone the development of my professional and personal discipline.
	</p><p>
	Throughout my life I have enjoyed assisting family and friends with their technical challenges and I now enjoy assisting business colleagues and the business community address their technical and related business issues.I have assisted others in developing functional and effective websites allowing them to reach a larger audience with more clarity and well structured messages.  In conjunction with my peers at SJSU we implemented a Customer Relationship Management System for a local charity which allowed the charity to manage their database of donors much more effectively.
	</p><p>
	I have worked with Project Managers at CISCO to coordinate the necessary changes (updates and code fixes) to the applications used by the company’s sales force.
	</p><p>
	I am currently involved with exploring Usability and its relationship to design. I am currently the User Experience (UX) lead in charge of coordinating an effective design for the Cisco's partner tools (Web Applications).
