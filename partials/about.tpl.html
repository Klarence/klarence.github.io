		<p>I’m a Front-end Web Developer currently freelancing in San Jose, CA. I am technically proficient in HTML, CSS
			and implementing Javascript. Even though I get paid to develop websites, I also dabble in Graphic Design,
			Typography, Photography, Videography, and Animation. I love to stay on top of the latest technologies and immersemyself with everything the web has to offer.</p>
		<p>Now a little about myself. I am a 26-year-old student who came from New York, New York and enjoys learning about technology and experiencing the outdoors. Ever since I can remember I have enjoyed going camping and traveling around the world. Many people have told me that I am extremely organized and forward thinking in my work.</p>
<p>I studied and lived in Sweden after I graduated from high school, which was an experience that I will never forget. While in the country I learned how to speak Swedish fluently and I wish it had made a positive impact on my business, since so few people speak Swedish in the United States.</p>
<p>When I returned back the United States about three years later, I reentered the world of education. At MiraCosta College, I found my true love for technology. After completing a Photoshop and Flash class, I knew that Web Development was the career path I wanted to choose.</p>
<p>I am graduating in Spring 2011 with an Associate of Arts Web Development &amp; Design. I am also receiving a Certificate of Achievement for Graphic Design and Video &amp; Media Design. With my prerequisites completed for being a business degree, I feel confident that I am well prepared for San Jose State University’s Management Information Systems degree program.</p>
